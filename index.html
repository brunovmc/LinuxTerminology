            <p>A boot loader is a program responsible for loading the Linux kernel with optional kernel parameters and the Linux initial RAM disk, known as initrd.</p>
            <p>Linux kernel is the core of the Linux operating system, and it starts the init (short for initialization) process, or an init replacement such as systemd, immediately after being loaded.</p>
            <p>The Linux initial RAM disk provides a temporary storage space for loading critical files into memory before the real root file system can be mounted.</p>

            <p>Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions.</p>
            <p>Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.</p>
            <p>Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.</p>
            <p>The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh.</p>
            <p>Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.</p>

            <h2>desktop environment</h2>
            <p>, a desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer operating system,</p>
            <p> which share a common graphical user interface (GUI), sometimes described as a graphical shell.</p>
            <p>The desktop environment was seen mostly on personal computers until the rise of mobile computing.</p>
            <p>Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system.</p>
            <p>Instead, the traditional command-line interface (CLI) is still used when full control over the operating system is required.</p>
            <p>A desktop environment typically consists of icons, windows, toolbars, folders, wallpapers and desktop widgets (see Elements of graphical user interfaces and WIMP).</p>
            <p>A GUI might also provide drag and drop functionality and other features that make the desktop metaphor more complete.
            <p> A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world,</p>
            <p> such as buttons and windows.</p>

            <h2>shell</h2>
            <p>command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and instructs the operating system to perform accordingly</p>
            <p>a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services.</p>
            <p>In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation.</p>
            <p>It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel.</p>

            <h2>BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)</h2>
            <p>Starting an x86-based Linux system involves a number of steps.</p>
            <p>When the computer is powered on, the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) initializes the hardware,</p>
            <p>including the screen and keyboard, and tests the main memory.</p>
            <p>This process is also called POST (Power On Self Test).</p>
            <p>The BIOS software is stored on a ROM chip on the motherboard.</p>
            <p> After this, the remainder of the boot process is controlled by the operating system (OS).</p>

            <h2>GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)</h2>
            <p>GRUB is the most popular and the most feature-packed boot loader for the Linux operating system.</p>
            <p> It is based on the now obsolete GRUB Legacy, which was created in 1995 by Erich Boleyn for the operating system GNU/Hurd.</p>
            <p> GRUB supports both BIOS and UEFI, and it can handle all popular Linux file systems, including Btrfs, ext4, ReiserFS v3, VFAT, and XFS.</p>
            <p> Compared to GRUB Legacy, modern GRUB is cleaner, more powerful, and safer.</p>
